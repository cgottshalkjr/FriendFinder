**DATE A DIRECTOR** is a compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application -- basically a dating app. This full-stack site will take in results from your users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

### INSTRUCTIONS 
---
Navigate your way to the home page. Click Survey. And select from 1 **Strongly Disagree** to 5 **Strongly Agree** on the ten Statements provided and click submit. That's it! See what director you best match with. Add in a director of your own.
